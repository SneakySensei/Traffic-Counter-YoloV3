# Traffic-Counter-NeuralNetwork
Custom Object Detector written in python using YOLOv3 weights

## How to run the script
Since, GitHub doesn't allow files bigger than 100 MB to be added to repo, you'll need yolov3.weights in the project directory.
You can download them from: [YOLOv3 Weights (237 MB)](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

## What Next
I'm still figuring out tensorflow-gpu so I might make an identical script that uses gpu.

## Forking
You can use my code in any way you want. Just remember to star my repo. Credits would be nice too ðŸ˜€
